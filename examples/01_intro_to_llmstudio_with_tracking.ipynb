    "# Intro to LLMstudio - tracking\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook serves as an introduction to LLMstudio with a focus on tracking capabilities. It demonstrates how to set up and use the LLMstudio environment to interact with language models, specifically highlighting the integration of tracking functionalities. The notebook begins by starting the tracking server, which is essential for logging and monitoring interactions with the language models. This setup is crucial for you who need to keep track of model usage, performance metrics, and other relevant data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook further illustrates how to configure and utilize the tracking system by creating a `TrackingConfig` instance, which specifies the host and port for the tracking server. You can benefit from this setup by gaining insights into model behavior and performance, which can be used to optimize and improve their applications. The notebook also includes examples of both synchronous and asynchronous chat interactions, providing a comprehensive guide for developers to implement and test these features in their own projects.\n",
